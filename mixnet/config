# This parameter determine which version of the program is executed.# 0 stands for no optimization inside of the code
# 1 uses multi-exponentiation techniques
# 2 uses multi-exponentiation techniques and FFT to find values E_i
# 3 uses multi-exponentiation techniques, extra interaction and Toom-Cook 4 to find values E_i, in this case m =16 or 64\n

# Name of the file consisting the description of the groups used in the protocol
# If only one group is used the file should consist of the prime p, prime order q,  a generator of G   and a generator of Z_q
# If two different groups are used the file should consist of the prime p, prime order q, a generator of G, a generator of Z_q, the prime p1 and a generator of H
# Or set parameter to 0 if you want to define groups of own choice.
